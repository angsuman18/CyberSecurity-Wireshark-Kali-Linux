# CyberSecurity-Wireshark-Kali-Linux

Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer that allows you to capture and interactively browse the traffic running on a computer network. It is widely used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and protocol development, and education.

Here are some key features and uses of Wireshark:

1. **Live Capture and Offline Analysis**: Wireshark can capture data packets from a live network or read packets from a previously saved capture file.
2. **Deep Inspection**: It provides deep inspection of hundreds of protocols, with more being added all the time.
3. **Rich VoIP Analysis**: Wireshark can analyze Voice over IP (VoIP) calls in depth.
4. **Display Filters**: Powerful display filters allow you to focus on the packets you are interested in.
5. **Multi-Platform**: Wireshark runs on multiple operating systems, including Windows, Linux, macOS, Solaris, and others.
6. **Decryption Support**: Wireshark supports decrypting many protocols, including SSL/TLS, WEP, and WPA/WPA2.
7. **Extensive Capabilities**: It provides capabilities to create custom reports and statistics.
8. **Open Source**: Wireshark is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

### Basic Steps to Use Wireshark:

1. **Install Wireshark**: Download and install Wireshark from the official website [wireshark.org](https://www.wireshark.org/).
2. **Capture Packets**: Select the network interface to capture packets from and start the capture.
3. **Analyze Packets**: Use the provided filters and tools to analyze the captured data.
4. **Save and Export Data**: Save your captures and export them in various formats for further analysis.

### Common Use Cases:

- **Network Troubleshooting**: Identifying network issues by examining packet-level details.
- **Security Analysis**: Detecting security vulnerabilities and attacks.
- **Protocol Development**: Developing and testing network protocols.
- **Educational Purposes**: Learning about network protocols and how data travels across networks.
